%%  DecompEigToPSDConstruction
%   Uses semidefinite programming to implement Theorem 4 of the paper, and
%   thus shows that certain sets of numbers cannot be spectra of
%   decomposable symmetric entanglement witnesses.
%   
%   This function has one required argument:
%     mu: a row or column vector of d(d+1)/2 real eigenvalues, for some
%         integer 1 <= d <= 5.
%
%   pos = DecompEigToPSDConstruction(mu) outputs a boolean implementing
%   Theorem 4 from the paper: pos = 1 if there exist matrices Y such that
%   the inequalities all hold, and pos = 0 if no such matrices Y exist (so
%   there does not exist a decomposable symmetric entanglement witness with
%   eigenvalues mu).
%
%   [pos, Y] = DecompEigToPSDConstruction(mu) performs the same
%   calculation, but also outputs a cell array of k d*d matrices, for some
%   integer  1 <= k <= (d(d+1)/2)! such that if pos = 1 then they are the Y
%   matrices from Theorem 4, or NaN if no such set of matrices exist
%   (i.e., if pos = 0).
